## R6 Features List
    1. Play the game with questions

    Player navigates the text game answering questions to provide direction and to determine the actions they wish to take. Other questions may be answered correctly to obtain points. 

    2. Bonus and point tracking

    3. Highest score

    Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:

- at least THREE features

- describe each feature, providing a walkthrough of the logic of the application.


Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:

- use of variables and the concept of variable scope

- loops and conditional control structures

- error handling


Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .

## R7
Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 


> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

## R8
Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
- how to use any command line arguments made for the application
## R9
mplement features in the software development plan you have designed. You must utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Python such as:

- variables and variable scope

- loops and conditional control structures

- write and utilise simple functions

- error handling

- input and output

- importing a Python package

- using functions from a Python package

## R10
Apply DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding principles to all code produced.
## R11 
Apply all style and conventions for the programming language consistently to all code produced.
## R12
Creates an application which runs without error and has features that are consistent with the development plan.
## R13
Utilise source control throughout the development of the application by:

- making regular commits (at least 20 commits) with a commit message that summarises the changes

- pushing all commits to a remote repository
## R14
Utilise developer tools to facilitate the execution of the application:

For example,

- writing a script which turns the application into an executable

    Player navigates map to get to from the starting point to the finish point and avoids dieing. 
    They answer questions allong the way to secure points and if lucky may find a hidden object to obtain a key.
